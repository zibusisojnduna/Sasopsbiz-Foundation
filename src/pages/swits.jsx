                <h3>Partner: R-WVLSA | Participants: 200</h3>

                <p>The SWITS programme breaks gender barriers in technical and vocational trades. It trains women in painting, plumbing, carpentry, and detergent production — equipping them with practical, income-generating skills.
Through community-based projects such as refurbishing local halls and repairing school furniture, SWITS promotes hands-on learning, employment creation, and community renewal.
It’s empowerment with purpose — women building communities, and communities building women.</p>
